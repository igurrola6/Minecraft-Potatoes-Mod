# Minecraft Potatoes Mod
A Minecraft Mod for version 1.15.1 that adds new items, tools, armor, and blocks. 

This mod adds new potato blocks which can be mined for new potatoes. Each new potato can be eaten and in doing so will grant you a potion effect. Each potato block has different rarities which corresponds with how useful their tools and armor are. Once you have one of each potato you can craft the powerful color potato. Not every potato can be mined and some require various ingredients to craft, so it can get complicated. That is why I created a documentation file that tells you everything you need to know. The link is on the modâ€™s information page, but I will also link it here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gHvwHGLDInHleOl17DRVAycAwvTFJBGfUHdbSBxxARs/edit
